TODO list for todo.sh

- Display entries by date they were entered? Is this on anyone's wishlist?
- Figure out how to do somthing like:
    if x is in field y, do something
- Right now, the script exits after it does almost any task. Should it keep running?
 e.g. Maybe for deleting a line, it should loop and ask if you want to delete another.
      (Put a while loop in the function)
- Disable colors in my nano. Holy shit.
