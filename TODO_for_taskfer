TODO list for todo.sh



#TODO: 

### MOVE TAGS in the tasklist after the message, so they can be different lengths without spoiling the view.
# Multiple tags per entry??? 

# propagate filename changes throughout script 
#    (tmplist done;    tasklist, pager, editor?)
# Figure out how to pad the tags, so the fields line up.

#  *** add a deleter/reminder for stuff which is 
# already in the past - Almost!!! ***
# This actually works in .03d.5, but I don't like the fact
# that it just replaces the file. I wanted to edit the file inline
# with sed. Maybe I'm just being picky.

# *** Question: ***  is output for deleting an entry better reversed,
# so that the oldest entries are at the bottom? It's not a problem in
# a terminal, but it might be a problem in a console.

#WISHLIST
# Export sorted lists to file?
# Find a use for date-of-entry field?
# Display entries by date they were entered? Is this on anyone's wishlist?


# Changes in .03d.5
#
# Added test to recall functions to get rid of error message if
# no tmpfile gets created (if no entries match the recall).
#
# New variable, $taskfer_dir = $HOME/.taskfer - makes it easier
# to use a different directory for taskferrc, tmpfile and tasklist.
#
# Recalls (-d, -l, -t, -w)  no longer show "Entered on..." 
# or the colons between fields.
#
# Recall tags (-t) no longer shows the tag. If your memory is that short,
# a task manager won't help.
#
# Clean old entries at once (-clean) works, but it's not the solution
# I wanted. It selects newer entries and replaces the task list file,
# while making a dated backup copy of the old task list. 


#Changes in .03d4
# Use no argument to make an entry. You'll be promted to enter all 
# fields, separated by semi-colons. No quotes are needed for free-form
# dates or for text, even with parentheses. Don't use semi-colons in 
# your text, or the text field will be cut short. If you don't like 
# that, change the field separator on line 330 and in awk around 
#lines 332, 333, and 335, or convince me to do it. I'm undecided.

# Changes in .03d3
# Fixed bug in todo -x (to delete a line)
# If you entered nothing, it deleted all lines
# in the tasklist. Better now.


# Changes in .03d
# Interactive entry (-i) asks question for each field.
# Recall range of dates. (-w)
# Delete lines without having to answer yes after each one. (-y)
# Almost: delete all entries with old due dates.








Notes about v.03b
Sanity check for dates works. If you enter a date in the past, it warns you and asks if you want to proceed.
Nadir figured out how to specific fields, and that code allows more than one character in the tag field.
Sorting is still a problem. Even with 'sort -n' or 'sort -h' it still sorts the tag field first. 
Some punctuation in the text field causes pukage. If that happens, put quotes around the text entry.
Semi-colons and parentheses do it. I don't know what else.



Note about the name.
I've been calling it todo.  Telemachus started using tasker. There's alreay an android app called tasker. There's also one called task that's in the debian repos. There's also a tasky and a tasque. I came up with taskfer. Nadir likes it. So I started using it inside the script.
Taskfer carries your tasks. I wish it would do mine for me.



These are done except for the colors. That seems to be inconsistent.

- Done - Figure out how to do somthing like:
    if x is in field y, do something
- Right now, the script exits after it does almost any task. Should it keep running?
 e.g. Done - Maybe for deleting a line, it should loop and ask if you want to delete another.
      (Put a while loop in the function)
- Disable colors in my nano. Holy shit.
